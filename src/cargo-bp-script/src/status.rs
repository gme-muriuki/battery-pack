//! Schema for `cargo bp status --json` output.
//!
//! These types are the stable, machine-consumable representation of
//! `cargo bp status`. They are emitted by the CLI when invoked with
//! `--json` and parsed by the [`runner`](crate::runner) module.
//!
//! # Construction
//!
//! Each type follows the same `new(required)` + chainable `with_*`
//! setters pattern. Required fields are positional arguments to
//! `new`; optional / collection-shaped fields are populated via
//! `with_*` methods. New fields added in future schema versions get
//! a new `with_*` setter rather than changing `new()`'s signature,
//! so producers don't break.
//!
